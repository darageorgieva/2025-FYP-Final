# Projects in Data Science (2025) - Final Assignment - Group Zorro

## Instructions for running the project
Below you can find instructions on how to run [main_baseline.py](main_baseline.py) and [main_extended.py](main_extended.py).

You need to have the following in the `data` folder:
- the folder containing the lesion images - name should be "images"
- the folder containing all the masks - name should be "Masks"
- `metadata.csv`

Then all you need to do is provide the path to the project folder (2025-FYP-Zorro) and assign it to the variable `path` in the bottom of the files.

After running `main.extended` it would be also possible to run our plots. To run the plots do the same by assigning your path to `base_path`.
